We faced a lot of issues with Ananya's sleep from 3-6 months of her age. 
She used to sleep only on the lap and would want me to feed her every now and then throughout the night.


As new parents we were sleepless for nights in a row. 
In such situations generally mothers are told that all kids do this and that the mother is bound to have sleepless nights 
even if she is a working woman.
But we knew this would not work since it would affect Ananya's growth due to the lack of sound sleep. 

We desperately were in search of something to solve this alarming concern.

The only solution to this was sleep training!

To set some context: Sleep training is letting your child sleep on their own without any support from you. 
Support of the nature of nursing, rocking, sush-ing etc.

We started to sleep train Ananya since she was about 6 months old.

There was a lot of to and fro from me, as a mother to come to a decision point whether to sleep train or not.

As other parents, we had our own reservations when it came to choosing this route for the baby.

As usual read a lot about it, 
but this time was confused since there is a lot of material on the internet in support of both sides of the coin strongly.

Contacted a few fellow mums about it too ..@neha ;) and decided to go for it.

Ananya is now 9 months old.

Yesterday she slept straight for 12 hours without waking up for feeding even once.

I can now safely say that she is a sleep trained baby, she takes 11-12 hours of night sleep and 2-3 hours of day naps.

Now she feeds only once throughout the night.

And now does not associate feeding with sleep, that allows the father or any other caretaker to help in the process of putting the baby to sleep if required.

She sleeps independently in her own crib. It not only gives her a sound sleep but also inculcates a sense of self-dependence in kids.

It has helped Ananya and us have a good nights sleep, which is very much necessary for the baby for her development and equally required for the parents to maintain energy levels throughout the day running behind the little one along with balancing work and household chores (especially in the pandemic situation.)

This seems to be a dream come true for new parents.


Had to face a lot of resistance and judgement for choosing a non-traditional way of putting the baby to sleep, but the key is that parents should stay strong and believe in the process and be totally committed to it knowing its doing good to the child.

Initially, it seemed impossible and cruel, but its the best gift you can give your baby and yourselves and your family who is taking care of the baby.

All it requires is to follow a disciplined timely schedule for nap times, nursing and feeding solids to the baby, and a night time routine which helps the baby to know what to expect when taken into the sleeping space.

Need not be an elaborate process but having a schedule makes the child feel secure since they know what to expect and whats coming next.

We used a few things to help Ananya through the training i.e a comfortable crib with simple bedding. No toys in the crib and a night vision motion detection baby cam to help us watch her. Sleep training can be done without these two things as well!

In this journey Ananya went through different phases where in, at times, her routine was a bit disturbed. But, all that we, as parents, need to do, is put the smile on and follow the process with confidence and ignore all the resistance that goes on in the background.

Irrespective of the rapid changes and regressions going on with her, the sleep has been constant with timings a bit here and there.

Watching the baby having a sound sleep is the most relaxing for new parents.

Thank you so so much! Ajita @kidscenter, she guided and walked us through the process and instilled confidence that it was the right thing to do.Thanks a lot for doing your magic and helping us through the process.Your experience with kids is helping parents maintain their sanity via a good nights sleep!

Ananya when wakes up, she lazes around in the crib for a while and loves spending a good 10-15 mins by herself just chilling with herself.

Once she is done doing that she calls out for someone to pick her up and indicates she is done with her sleep.

Even if she is not done with her sleep, she adjusts her position finds a comfortable one and snoozes off on her own. Imagine a 9 month-old being so independent and happy sleeping all by herself, seems like magic, that's what sleep training does ðŸ˜„
